# Longest run

Write a function that returns the longest run of numbers that increment by 1:

	q)longestRun 3 6 2 3 4 8 3 4 5 6 1 4 2
	3 4 5 6
	q)longestRun 3 6 2 3 4 8 3 4 5 6 1 4 2 3 4 5 6 7
	2 3 4 5 6 7
	q)longestRun 1 2 4 1 2 3 6 7 3
	1 2 3

**Note**: Alf's optimal solution for this isn't that optimal! Opportunity to outdo him here.
